instructions:
  - Season zucchini with salt and let drain for at least 30 min

  - Place zucchini in a bowl and add herbs, lemon zest, pepper, grated garlic, chopped capers and green onions.
  - Add the egg and enough flour and breadcrumbs for the mixture to be able to form patties easily.
  - Put the mixture in the fridge for an hour 
  - Once chilled, form small patties (50g each) 
  - Heat 1-2cm oil in a small pan. Once hot, fry fritters for 2-3 mins on each side.
  - For the tzatziki, finely grate the cucumber (about 1 cup), set in a fine-mesh strainer set over a small mixing bowl and using a thin towel squeeze all the extra moisture out. Should go down to about a quarter cup.
  - Add vegan yogurt to a large mixing bowl and add cucumber, garlic, dill, salt, pepper, lemon juice, and 1 tbsp olive oil.
  - Add more salt, garlic, lemon juice or dill as needed by taste.
