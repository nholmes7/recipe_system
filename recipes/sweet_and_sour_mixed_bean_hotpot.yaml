instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
  - Thinly slice the potatoes and parboil them for 4 minutes. Drain the potatoes thoroughly, toss them in the oil so they are lightly coated all over and set aside.
  - Place the butter, flour, passata, apple juice, sugar, ketchup, sherry, vinegar and soy sauce in a saucepan. Heat gently, whisking continuously, until the sauce comes to the boil and thickens. Continue to simmer gently for 3 minutes, stirring all the time.
  - Rinse and drain the beans and chickpeas and add to the sauce with all the remaining ingredients, except the herb garnish. Stir well to mix them thoroughly,
  - Spoon the bean mixture into a casserole.
  - Arrange the potato slices over the top, overlapping them slightly so that they completely cover the bean mixture.
  - Cover the casserole with foil and bake for about 1 hour, until the potatoes are cooked and tender. Remove the foil for the last 20 minutes of the cooking time, to lightly brown the potatoes. Serve garnished with fresh herb sprigs.
