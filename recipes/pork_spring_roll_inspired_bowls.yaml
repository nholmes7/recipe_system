instructions:
  - Peel, then grate 1/2 tbsp (1 tbsp) ginger. Heat a medium pot over medium heat. When hot, add sesame oil, then 1 tsp (2 tsp) ginger and rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is toasted, 2-3 min. Add 1 1/4 cups (2 1/2 cups) water and 1/8 tsp (1/4 tsp) salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low. Cover and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 12-14 min. Remove the pot from heat. Set aside, still covered.
  - Meanwhile, thinly slice green onions. Peel, then mince or grate garlic.
  - Add cabbage and carrot, vinegar, green onions, 1 tbsp (2 tbsp) oil and 1/4 tsp (1/2 tsp) sugar to a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then toss to combine. Set aside.
  - Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp (1 tbsp) oil, then pork. Cook, breaking up pork into smaller pieces, until no pink remains, 4-5 min. Add garlic, hoisin sauce and remaining ginger. Cook, stirring often, until pork is coated, 1-2 min. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
  - Fluff rice with a fork, then stir in sesame seeds. Divide rice between bowls. Top with pork and slaw. Drizzle plum sauce over top. Sprinkle with crispy shallots.
