ingredients:
  - wide rice noodles 6 ounces
  - soy sauce 0.33 cups
  - maple syrup 3 tbsp
  - fish sauce 2 tbsp
  - rice vinegar 2 tbsp
  - black pepper
  - chili flakes
  - sesame oil 3 tbsp
  - ground chicken 0.75 lbs
  - red bell pepper 1 thinly sliced
  - salted butter 3 tbsp
  - shallot 1 sliced
  - garlic 6 cloves chopped
  - eggs 2-3 beaten
  - mung bean sprouts 2 cups
  - thai basil 0.5 cups chopped
  - cilantro 0.5 cups chopped
  - green onions 4 chopped
  - roasted peanuts 0.33 cups chopped
instructions:
  - Soak the rice noodles according to packaged directions. Drain.
  - To make the sauce. In a bowl, combine the tamari/soy sauce, maple syrup, fish sauce, rice vinegar, black pepper, and chili flakes.
  - Add the oil, chicken, and red bell pepper to a large skillet set over medium heat. Cook until the chicken is browned all over, about 5 minutes. Add the butter, shallot, garlic, and a pinch of chili flakes and black pepper. Continue to cook the chicken in the butter until the garlic begins to turn golden, 1-2 minutes.
  - Add the noodles and sauce, tossing to combine. Cook until the noodles are warmed through and begin soaking up the sauce, about 1 minute. Push the noodles to one side of the skillet and add the eggs to the other side. Let cook until the edges start to set, 1 minute. Roughly scramble the egg, then toss it with the noodles. Remove from the heat. 
  - Add the bean sprouts, cilantro, and green onions, and toss again.
  - Serve warm noodles topped with basil, green onions, peanuts, and chili flakes. Add a squeeze of lime juice.
