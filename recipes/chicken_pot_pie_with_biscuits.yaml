instructions:
  - Biscuits: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Mix flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together. Grate butter and work it into the dry mix with your hands. Add milk and stir gently with a fork to bring it all together. Turn dough out onto a clean counter. Fold it over a few times to get it into a 1-2 inch thick layer. Roll into a flat little block and cut 6-8 biscuits from it using a biscuit cutter, rim of a drinking glass, or… just a knife. Let’s not be too precious here.
  - Filling: Melt the butter in a large oven-safe Dutch oven or pan. Add the shallots, garlic, and thyme; sauté for 5 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, and 1 teaspoon of salt; sauté for 5 minutes. Add the flour; let it cook for 1-2 minutes. Add wine; let it sizzle out. The mixture will be sticky and thick. Don’t panic. You’re doing it right. Slowly and gradually, add the chicken broth, milk, and cream. Stir and let it rest a bit after each addition. After a few minutes the mixture should resemble a thick, creamy soup. Add chicken and peas. Season to taste with remaining salt, pepper, and just a tiny bit of lemon juice. Remove sprigs of thyme.
  - Bake: Arrange biscuits on top of filling. Brush biscuits with milk or butter for extra browning. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until hot, bubbly, and biscuits are cooked through. Let rest for 10 minutes before serving and season with salt and pepper to taste! YUM.
