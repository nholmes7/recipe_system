  main ingredients:
    - sesame oil 2 tbsp
    - ground beef 1 lb
    - black pepper ground
    - shallots 2 medium
    - garlic 4 cloves
    - fresh ginger 1 inch peeled and minced
    - lemongrass 2 tbsp thinly sliced
    - red bell pepper 1 unit chopped
    - raw cashews 0.33 cups
    - soy sauce 0.25 cups
    - fish sauce 1 tbsp
    - sambal oelek 3 tbsp
    - honey 2 tsp
    - fresh basil 0.5 cups
  for serving:
    - seasoned coconut rice or steamed rice
    - quick pickled red onions
    - fresh herbs (basil, cilantro, and/or mint) 1 cup
    - carrots 2 medium shredded
    - cucumber thinly sliced
    - green onion 4 units thinly sliced
    - mango 1 unit peeled and thinly sliced or diced
    - limes 2 cut into wedges
instructions:
  - Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  When the oil shimmers, add the meat.  Season with black pepper and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 5 minutes.
  - Add the shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, bell pepper, and cashews.  Cook, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes more.
  - Add 0.25 cups of water, the soy sauce, fish sauce, sambal oelek, and honey.  Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a boil.  Cook, stirring, until the sauce coats the meat, 5 to 8 minutes.  Stir in the basil until just wilted, about 1 minute, and remove the skillet from the heat.
  - Divide the rice among the bowls and spoon the meat over the top.  Top the bowls as desired with pickled onions, herbs, carrots, cucumbers, green onions, and mango.  Serve with lime wedges for squeezing.
