category: Main
ingredients:
  - Olive Oil 2 tbsp
  - Red Onion 1 units, chopped
  - Bell Pepper 1 units, chopped
  - Carrot 2 units, chopped
  - Celery 2 units, chopped
  - Salt 0.5 tsp
  - Garlic 4 units, minced
  - Chili Powder 2 tbsp,  
  - Cumin 2 tsp
  - Paprika 1.5 tsp
  - Oregano 1 tsp
  - Diced Tomatoes 1 units
  - Black Beans 2 units, rinsed and drained
  - Pinto Beans 1 units, rinsed and drained
  - Vegetable Stock 2 cups
  - Bay Leaf 1 units
  - Vinegar 1.5 tsp
  - Cilantro
  - Lime Juice
instructions:
  - In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped onion, bell pepper, carrot, celery and 0.25 teaspoon salt.
  - Stir to combine and then cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the onion is translucent, about 7 to 10 minutes.
  - Add the garlic, chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika and oregano. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 1 minute.
  - Add the diced tomatoes and their juices, the drained black beans and pinto beans, vegetable broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine and let the mixture come to a simmer.
  - Continue cooking, stirring occasionally and reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, for 30 minutes. Remove the chili from heat.
  - For the best texture and flavor, transfer 1.5 cups of the chili to a blender and blend until smooth, then pour the blended mixture back into the pot.
  - Add the chopped cilantro, stir to blend, and then mix in the vinegar, to taste. Add salt to taste, too - I added 0.25 teaspoon more at this point.
