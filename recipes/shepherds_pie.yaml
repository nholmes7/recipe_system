category: Meal
ingredients:
  - Olive oil 2 tbsp
  - Shallots 3 units, minced
  - Mushrooms 454 g, sliced
  - Carrot 6 units, peeled and chopped
  - Rosemary
  - Thyme
  - Bay Leaf
  - Tomato Paste 2 tbsp
  - Flour 2 tbsp
  - Red Wine 0.5 cups
  - Veggetable Broth 1.5 cups
  - Salt 1 tsp
  - Peas 2 cups
  - Potato 6 units
  - Butter 0.25 cups
  - Milk
instructions:
  - Make the mashed potatoes: Peel the potatoes.  Boil them until fork tender (you want them to mash easily). Drain, mash and mix in the yogurt and butter.  Season to taste.
  - Make the veggies:  IN a large oven-safe pot, heat the oil over medium heat.  Add shallots and saute until fragrant.  Add mushrooms, carrots, and whole herbs (you will pull the herbs out later). Saute until carrots are softened.
  - Make the gravy:  Add tomato paste and four to the pot and stir.  Pour in the red wine (sizzzzzle) and scrape all the browned bits off the bottom of the pan.  Let the wine cook out for a minute or two.  Slowly add the broth, stirring it in until a gravy starts to form.  Season with salt.  Simmer over low heat to get it thickened even further.
  - Bake:  Remove the herbs.  Stir in the peas, spread the mashed potatoes on top (brush with butter to be extra awesome), and bake for 15 minutes at 350.  I finished mine on the broil setting for a few minutes to get it nice and brown on top.
