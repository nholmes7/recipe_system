instructions:
  - Soak cashews in a bowl of cold water for 4 hours.
  - Drain the water that the cashews were soaking in.  Blend the nuts in a food processor with half the lemon juice, tamari, 2/3 cup of water, salt and pepper until smooth and creamy.  This may take a couple of minutes
  - Place the Quinoa in a sieve and rinse with cold water until the water that comes through is totally clear.
  - Place the quinoa in a saucepan with 2.5 cups of boiling water and a little salt and pepper and lemon juice.
  - Let the quinoa boil for a minute or two, then simmer for another 10-15 minutes, covered, until all the water has been absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy, but not mushy.
  - Cut the avocados in half and scoop out their flesh, placing it into a bowl.  Use a fork to mash the avocados.  Stir the tomato, jalapeno pepper and cilantro into the mashed avocado with the lime juice, salt and pepper.
  - Slice the tomatoes into quarters, then finely chop these into small squares.  Place the tomatoes in a bowl, pour over the lime juice and olive oil and add a little salt and pepper.
  - Drain the black beans, then pour them into a large saucepan.  Add the garlic to the pan, along with a drizzle of olive oil and some salt.  Heat through for a few minutes.
  - To serve, place the quinoa in the middle of the bowl, then add the cashew cream, black beans, salsa, and guacamole around the quinoa.
