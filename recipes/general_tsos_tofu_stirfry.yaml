  - Water 1 tbsp
  - Sesame Oil 1 tbsp

instructions:
  - If serving with rice and broccoli, begin preparing at this time. Otherwise, move on to the next step.
  - Wrap tofu in a clean absorbent towel and set something heavy on top to wick away moisture, such as a cast iron skillet. Let rest for about 10 minutes.
  - Prepare/chop green onions, garlic, and ginger at this time. Set aside.
  - Well tofu is pressing, prepare sauce by combining sesame oil, cornstarch, minced garlic, minced ginger, rice vinegar, coconut sugar or maple syrup, tamari or soy sauce, and water in a small mixing bowl and whisk thoroughly to combine. If using coconut sugar, make sure it is dissolved before proceeding. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
  - Heat a large metal or cast iron skillet over medium heat. In the meantime, unwrapped tofu and cut into even pieces, about 3/4 inch cubes.
  - Add tofu to a shallow mixing bowl and top with tamari or soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, sesame oil, and maple syrup. Toss to combine. Let rest 2 to 3 minutes stirring occasionally.

  - To the hot skillet, add 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil and let warm for 30 seconds. Then use a slotted spoon or fork to add tofu to the pan leaving any excess cornstarch behind.
  - Cook on all sides for 1 minute, or until light golden brown. You do not want it blackened or burned as you will be cooking it again later with the sauce. Aim for a consistent golden brown crust. Remove tofu from pan as it is finished browning. Set aside.
  - Return skillet to burner and increase heat to medium-high. Add 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, chopped green onions, and dried red chilies. Saute for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
  - Add the sauce and tofu. Cook, stirring frequently, to coat the tofu and vegetables for 1 to 2 minutes, or until warmed through and the sauce has a slightly thickened.
  - Remove pan from heat and add sesame seeds. Toss to coat.
  - Serve with rice and steamed broccoli, or other desired sides. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep two to three days in the refrigerator. Reheat on the stove top or microwave.
