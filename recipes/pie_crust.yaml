title: Pie Crust
category: Dessert
ingredients:
  - Cake and pastry flour 1.25 cups, Can use regular flour too
  - Sea salt 0.25 tsp
  - Cold butter  0.33 cups, Or use lard or shortening
  - Water 5 tbsp, Make sure it is cold, add an ice cube
instructions:
  - In a medium bowl, mix together the flour and salt.
  - Cut in the fat using a pastry blender or two knives. Be careful not to overmix (I found this to take forever and used my hands). It should resemble coarse crumbs. Little chunks of butter left in are okay and give a flakier end result
  - Carefully add the water one tablespoon at a time. You are looking for the dough to stick together and form a rough ball, but do not want a sticky mess. Err on the side of crumbly. You can use your hands to form the ball but do not overwork the dough.
  - Generously flour countertop and roll out dough until several inches larger than the diameter of your 9" pie pan. Fill with favourite pie filling and bake as directed in the pie recipe or refrigerate until you need it. Tip: butter the pie plate!
