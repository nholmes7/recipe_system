category: Main
ingredients:
  - Coconut oil 2 tbsp
  - Yellow onion 1 halved
  - Cauliflower 2 cups, chopped
  - Green beans 1 cups, chopped
  - Carrot 1 unit, chopped
  - Chickpeas 1.5 cups
  - Garam masala 1 tsp
  - Garlic 1 clove, minced
  - Fresh ginger 2 tsp, minced
  - Coconut oil 1 tbsp
  - Basmati rice 2 cups
  - Cinnamon stick 1 unit
  - Bay leaf 1 unit
  - Garam masala 1 tsp
  - Fresh ginger 1 tsp, minced
  - Garlic 1 clove, minced
  - Vegetable broth 4 cups
  - Turmeric 0.25 tsp, mixed with 1 tbsp water
  - Cashews or almond 0.25 cups, chopped
  - Golden raisins 0.25 cups
  - Cilantro, Garnish
instructions:
  - Cook the veggies: in a large Soup pot, warm up one tablespoon of the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the onions and saute until they start to Brown all over, about 7 Minutes. Remove them from the pot and set those bastards aside.
  - In that same pot, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Toss in the cauliflower, green beans, and carrot and sautee that s*** around until they start to soften up and get brown in a few spots, about 5 minutes. Fold in the chickpeas, garam masala, garlic, and ginger and cook for another minute to get the spices all mixed up. Remove from the heat, remove all the veggies from the pot, and set them off by the onions.
  - Make the rice: in that same damn pot, warm up the coconut oil over medium heat. Add the rice, cinnamon, bay leaf, garam masala, ginger, and garlic and saute that s*** until the spices start to smell delicious, about 1 minute. Add veggie broth and bring it all to a simmer. Reduce the heat to Low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender and the liquid has evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle the turmeric mixture over about half of the cooked rice and let it sit with the heat off for a minute to absorb.
  - To serve, fluff the rice with a fork, fold in the veggies, 3/4 of the onions, the nuts, and raisins. Top with some cilantro and the rest of the onions and serve that s*** up right away.
