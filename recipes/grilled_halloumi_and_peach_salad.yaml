category: Salads
ingredients:
  - Halloumi 250 g
  - Tofu 250 g
  - Lemon Juice 3 tbsp
  - Olive oil 0.25 cups,  
  - Garlic 2 cloves, minced
  - Oregano 1.5 tsp
  - Salt 0.25 tsp
  - Pepper 0.25 tsp
  - Mixed baby greens 6 cups
  - Peaches 2 units, unpeeled, cut into wedges
  - Black Olives 0.25 cups, sliced in half
  - Cherry tomatoes 1 cups
instructions:
  - Oil grill well and preheat the BBQ to medium-high.
  - Place sliced cheese/tofu in a shallow dish just large enough to hold it.  In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tbsp of lemon juice, 1 tbsp of the olive oil, the garlic, and 1 tsp of oregano.  Spoon over Halloumi; turn to coat.
  - To make dressing, whisk remaining lemon juice with remaining oregano and oil; add salt and pepper and set aside.
  - In a large bowl, toss greens with peaches and olives.  Skewer tomatoes for easier grilling.  Place Halloumi and tomatoes on grill.  Barbecue Halloumi about 2 mins per side and tomatoes 2 to 4 min in total, or just until grill marks appear.
  - Toss salad with dressing.  Divide among plates.  Top each salad with grilled Halloumi and tomatoes.
