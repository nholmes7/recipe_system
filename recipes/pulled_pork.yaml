ingredients:
  Pork:
    - Boneless pork butt 4 lb
    - Dark brown sugar 3 tbsp, packed
    - Salt 1 tbsp
    - Smoked paprika 1 tbsp
    - Garlic powder 1 tsp
    - Ground cumin 1 tsp
    - Onion powder 1 tsp
    - Black pepper
    - Vegetable oil 2 tbsp
    - Lager 12 oz
  BBQ Sauce & Sandwiches:
    - Ketchup 1.5 cups
    - Dijon mustard 0.5 cups
    - Apple cider vinegar 0.33 cups
    - Dark brown sugar 0.25 cups, packed
    - Worcestershire sauce 2 tbsp
    - Toasted buns, for serving
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 300°. Trim excess fat from pork and cut into large pieces to fit in a large Dutch oven.
  - In a small bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, paprika, garlic powder, cumin, and onion powder; season with black pepper. Rub all over pork. (This can be done the night before.) 
  - In large Dutch oven over medium high heat, heat oil. Working in batches, cook pork until browned on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. (Spices can burn quickly, so don’t let it go for too long!) Pour beer around pork and cover with a lid.
  - Bake pork until just beginning to turn tender, about 3 hours. Uncover and continue to bake until pork is very tender and easily pulls apart with a fork, 1 to 2 hours more.
  - Transfer pork to a cutting board, reserving pan drippings in pot, and let rest until ready to use.
  - Into pan drippings, whisk ketchup, mustard, vinegar, brown sugar, and Worcestershire until combined. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.
  - Shred pork (the stand mixer is magic for this). Add meat to sauce and toss to combine. Serve warm with buns and remaining sauce alongside.
