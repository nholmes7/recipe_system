category: Meal
ingredients:
  - Cilantro 1 handful
  - Garlic 2 units
  - Lemon Juice 2 units
  - Olive Oil 2 tbsp
  - Honey 2 tbsp
  - Apple Puree 2 tbsp
  - Cumin 1 tbsp
  - Turmeric 1 tbsp

instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 400 F.
  - Add all the ingredients, except the chickpeas, pine nuts, brown rice or chickpea flour, to a food processor.  Blend until everything is mixed well, but the texture is still a little chunky and not totally smooth.
  - Place the chickpeas and pine nuts in the food processor and blend for about 20 seconds until they are broken up, but have not totally disintegrated into hummus.
  - Roll the mixture into about 12 balls using your hands and place these in the fridge for about 30 minutes to set.
  - Once set, remove them from the fridge, coat them in brown rice or chickpea flour and bake them for about 45 mins until the outside is nice and crispy.
